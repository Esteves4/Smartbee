# Smartbee
The main objective of this project is to describe the behavior of bees in healthy hives and ready for pollination. Through real-time and minimally invasive monitoring, data from hives and colonies will be collected through heterogeneous sensors, connected to sensing devices with embedded radios. The data will be stored in a computational cloud and accessed remotely via the Web.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your arduino for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
The Arduino IDE
Thingspeak account

Microcontroller: ........... Arduino nano
Sensor: .................... DHT22
RF transceiver/receiver: ... nRF24L01
GSM Module: ................ SIM800L
```

### Libraries(Bibliotecas)

You can find them [here](Bibliotecas).
```
- RF24Network
- RF24
- DHT
- JeeLib
- SPI
```

### Installing

The steps to get the project up and running:
- [ ] Install the libraries
- [ ] Install the hardware on arduino

1. To install the libraries 
    - Download the .zip libraries. [Here](Bibliotecas)
    - Follow this tutorial from Arduino website and go to section "Importing a .zip Library". [Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
    
```
P.S.: The SPI library is already installed with the arduino IDE
```
- [x] Install the libraries
- [ ] Install the hardware on arduino

2. To install the hardware on arduino
