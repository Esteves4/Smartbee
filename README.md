# Sm@rtbee
The main objective of this project is to describe the behavior of bees in healthy hives and ready for pollination. Through real-time and minimally invasive monitoring, data from hives and colonies will be collected through heterogeneous sensors, connected to sensing devices with embedded radios. The data will be stored in a computational cloud and accessed remotely via the Web.
